		<h1>Review of the Premium Sailcloth Strap by StrapHabit </h1>
			
		<p class="lead">In a true definition of an impulse buy, I bought this strap without planning to do so in advance and without thinking about it carefully. I simply liked how it looked in the product photos. For watch strap geeks like myself, that was a good enough reason. But wearing this sailcloth strap has shown me that it's not only a looker. This is a super durable and comfortable strap also.</p>

			<h2>The Full Review</h2>
			
			
			<p>Sailcloth has all the properties to be one of the most popular materials for making watch straps. It is lightweight, durable, and its color does not fade even after prolonged sun exposure, as regular canvas straps tend to do. It doesn't smell funky like some leather hides do, and it is water-resistant. Additionally, it is cheaper and more readily available when compared to quality leather.</p>


			<p>Yet, we haven't seen many <a class="company-link" href="sailcloth">sailcloth straps</a> in the market. For sure, it is best known as a material of choice by Blancpain for their Fifty Fathoms watches, but that's simply an exception in the watch world.</p>


			<p>Companies that make replacement watch bands rarely source sailcloth. For that reason, I was very intrigued by StrapHabit's offering, and without too much thought, I bought their premium sailcloth model in green. It was worth it.</p>


			<p>Before delving into the nitty-gritty, here are the tech specs:</p>

			</table>
		

			<p>This model is available in a range of widths: 19mm, 20mm, 21mm, or 22mm. There are five color options to choose from. The colors are subdued, mostly in pastel tones.</p>

			<p>I bought the green strap, and I am very happy with how it looks.</p>

			<p>But it doesn't stop there: you can also choose a buckle in brushed stainless steel or in black PVD.</p>

			<p>Kudos to StrapHabit for offering such a variety.</p>
						


			<h2>Company + Purchasing Experience</h2>

			<p><a data-lta-event="review StrapHabit sailcloth r017"  target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="company-link" href="https://www.straphabit.com/">StrapHabit</a> is from Ohio, United States, and is one of the most reputable US retailers. They ship internationally and have a solid selection of various types of watch straps in many sizes and colors.</p>


			<p>Feel free to order from them. The ordering process is straightforward. They have a standard Shopify store, and you will easily navigate through all the ordering steps.</p>

			<p>The cool thing about StrapHabit is that they offer many deals and promotions. If you subscribe to their newsletter, you'll receive a 10% discount on your first order. There is also an ongoing "Buy 4 get 1 Free" deal that you can take advantage of using the code B4G1.</p>

			<p>They also offer an excellent after-sales experience by providing you with additional promos if you plan to become a returning customer.</p>


			<h2>Design and Materials</h2>

			<p>First thing that you notice when handling this strap is its very good construction. The top layer of the strap uses sailcloth, and for the underside, they have decided to go with thin leather. Sailcloth is much thicker compared to the underlying piece of leather. Overall thickness is not very high, totaling 3mm.</p>


			<p>There is boxed stitching around all the edges of the strap. Sailcloth is stitched using a matching green color, and the underlying piece of leather uses also a matching black-on-black thread. That's a cool attention to detail that I appreciate.</p>


			<p>By the way, everything is super tidy. There are no glue marks, loose threads, or asymmetrical stitches.</p>


			<p>On top of the sailcloth, there is a thin patch of leather that serves as a protective layer above the holes for the tang buckle tongue. Again, a very nice touch.</p>

			<p>There are two keepers, both made from sailcloth, but the first one is fixed and the second one is free.</p>


			<p>The strap has integrated quick-release spring bars. The signed buckle is made from stainless steel and even has two types of finishing. It is mostly a polished buckle with a brushed portion.</p>


			<p>The strap is delivered with both a regular and a long piece in the package, so you can easily (and without additional cost) achieve the perfect fit for your wrist size.</p>


			<p>Kudos to StrapHabit for creating such a product, especially at this price point.</p>

			<h2>Comfort and Durability</h2>

			<p>Today, this strap wears exceptionally well. The first time I put it on, that was not the case. I am not saying that the strap is uncomfortable; I am saying that you need to give it a bit of time to break in.</p>


			<p>It took me two weeks of occasional wear after which the strap adapted to the shape of my wrist, and it has been excellent ever since. I helped the process by intentionally bending the strap before putting it on.</p>


			<p>Just to be clear: the strap was never stiff or rigid. Simply, I needed to give it some time to loosen and become comfortable. This is actually pretty normal for fully-stitched straps.</p>


			<p>The watch remains securely positioned on the wrist, with no noticeable flopping, thanks in part to the textured leather lining providing additional grip.</p>

			  <figcaption>After two weeks of wear the strap adapted to the shape of my wrist.</figcaption>

			<p>In terms of durability, it's doing great. These pictures are recent, taken after using it for a few months. The holes haven't worn out, and there's no sign they will.</p>


			<p>One thing I noticed is that the strap bends in small parts. When I run my thumb across the bent strap, I can feel these segment that make up the bend. I am curious to see would these areas become weak and cause issues.</p>
			
			<p class="post-quote"><strong>Initial Usage</strong>
			The strap is made really well, with neat stitching, and it feels top quality. Putting it on for the few first times showed me that a break-in period is required.</p>
			
			<p class="post-quote"><strong>Two months of use</strong>
			The green color of the material is still the same. Zero fading or discoloration. The stitching is like new also. The holes in the buckle are not loose and haven't started fraying. The strap fits me just right now and feels really comfy. When I remove the watch, the strap bends a little, showing that it's completely worn in. </p>


			<h2>Showcase</h2>

			<p>I have a bunch of sport watches in my collection, and this strap fits every one of them perfectly. Its green color goes really well with both black and white dials. Check out these combinations below to see how awesome they look together!</p>

			<h2>Price and Value</h2>

			<p>If you want to buy this watch strap, you can get it straight from StrapHabit's website. Just go to their <a data-lta-event="review StrapHabit sailcloth r017"  target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="company-link" href="https://straphabit.com/collections/sailcloth-watch-straps">Sailcloth category page</a>. Then, pick the size and color you like.</p>

			<p>The strap costs $28, which is a great value considering its quality. I can confirm this firsthand, especially after seeing how well it held up in the last two months.</p>

			<p>If I compare it to other two-piece options then the decision to recommend this strap is even more easier. There are no quality leather straps that are this well constructed and live in this price point. Canvas straps? Hmm, they tend to lose color and fade easily. Rubber? Not as versatile and stylish as a fully-stitched sailcloth.</p>

			<p>This strap is a good buy and I recommend it. </p> 						

			
			

			<h2>Closing Words</h2>
			
			<p>I truly hope to see more brands explore the world of alternative materials for their watch straps, with sailcloth being a prime contender. It gives us versatile and a more durable two-piece option. And less expensive too.</p>

			<p>Until then, I'll often grab this sailcloth strap from my watch box. Give it a try too, and I assure you, you won't be disappointed.</p>

					<p>Exceptionally built sailcloth strap that brings tons of value, but you need to give it some time to break-in.</p>
