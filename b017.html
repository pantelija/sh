			<p>While <a class="company-link" href="b012">the hunt</a> is more focused on the journey, the pursuit, and the thrill of the chase, owning the watch is distinguished by a sense of fulfillment, enjoyment, and a deeper connection.</p>

			<p>In this blog post, I'll explore the idea that owning is definitely more important than the hunt in watch collecting.</p>

			

			<h2>Buying A Watch Is Not Merely A Transaction</h2>

			<p>Buying a watch is not merely a transaction; it's often a more profound experience that goes beyond the exchange of money for a watch.</p>

			<p>Owning a watch gives you the opportunity to build a personal narrative around it. Every scratch, every scuff, and every moment you wear it becomes a part of the story. Your watch becomes a companion in your life's adventures, and milestones. Graduations, weddings, promotions... It's not just a possession; it could be a reflection of who you are and what you've been through.</p>

			<p>Also, watches are often given as gifts for special occasions or passed down through generations. They can hold sentimental value and represent memories and relationships.</p>

			<h2>Chasing Trends And The Hype</h2>

			<p>We've all been there. We see a watch on Hodinkee or Fratello. A few weeks later, it's all over YouTube. Months pass by, and it's the main star of almost every wrist shot on Instagram. The constant exposure to the thing starts to creep in, and you simply have to buy the watch. But then you get the thing and realize you don't like it that much.</p>

			<p>It's because you've been chasing trends. Everyone was into the thing, so you had to get it as well. And then, when you unbox the watch, you realize it's not the thing you wanted but what everyone else wanted.</p>

			<p>Ideally, you have to enjoy the object more than the hunt. If not, then you were just chasing the hype.</p>

			<h2>Creating A Personal Connection</h2>

			<p>I think that only by owning and wearing a watch you can create a personal connection with it. When you've owned a watch for an extended period, you begin to understand its idiosyncrasies and quirks. You appreciate the way it fits on your wrist and how it becomes a part of your daily routine.</p>

			<p>On the other hand, constantly chasing trends may lead to a shallow and fleeting connection with watches in your collection. Watches become disposable, and you miss the opportunity to develop a deep, lasting relationship with any of them.</p>

			<h2>Wearing And Using The Watch</h2>

			<p>Owning a watch isn't just about putting it on display; it's about wearing and using it. You can't wear a hunt. A watch comes to life when it's on your wrist. You get to enjoy its functionalities, its design, or the utility of its features.</p>

			<p>Watches are meant to be appreciated in action. By wearing and using your watch, you truly understand its value and the joy it brings to your life. The hunt can become an endless quest that deprives you of the simple pleasure of enjoying the watches you already own. </p>

			<h2>Bringing It All Together</h2>

			<p>In this crazy watch world it's easy to fall into the trap of constantly hunting for the next big thing. The damn investment and hype piece. But it's good to remember that owning is more important than the hunt. The watches you own tell your story, reflect your personality, and offer a connection that goes beyond trends, hashtags, and fads.</p>

			<p>Yes, it's natural to be intrigued by the thrill of the hunt. But that lasts only a few days or weeks. In the end, it's about having the thing, owning it, and creating your own story with it.</p>
