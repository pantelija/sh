			<h2>The Full Review</h2>
			
			
			<p>Summer is the perfect season to get into <a class="company-link" href="perlon">the perlon straps</a>. These straps are lightweight, very comfortable and breathable. All the features we need during the warm weather. They also come in a wide array of vibrant colors, allowing for versatile styling options as the temperatures soar 
			
			<p>I wore standard perlons for quite some time, but one day I discovered <a class="company-link" href="cns-watch-bands">CNS &amp; Watch Bands</a> offering an upgraded version with better hardware.</p>

			<p>I purchased a burgundy-colored perlon 2.0 from the CNS, and I am excited to showcase its specifications and the full review.</p>

			<p>The Perlon 2.0 is available in various dimensions, including 18mm, 19mm, 20mm, and 22mm. Also, there are many colors to choose from: navy, green, grey, black and more.</p>
			
			


			<h2>Design and Materials</h2>

			<p>This <a data-lta-event="review CNS perlon r008" class="company-link" rel="noopener" href="https://cnswatchbands.com/fabric/perlon-watch-straps/">Perlon 2.0 strap</a> is made from braided nylon, measuring only 1mm in thickness. To prevent fraying, the edges are heat treated and then glued with a thin protective layer. The material is woven densely.</p>

			<p>The length is 280mm and in my case I don't have too much excess material that would otherwise tuck back in, as with regular natos.</p>

			</figure>
			
			<figure>
			  <img src="images/cns-perlon-adjustable-05.jpg" class="stoposto" alt="Adjustable Perlon Strap by CNS &amp; Watch Bands" />
			  <figcaption>The strap does not have a set of predefined holes, but you simply thread a buckle pin through the gap between the nylon braids.</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>The keepers are made entirely of metal, which is a departure from the usual nylon keepers found in most perlons. The buckle is a solid stainless steel piece with a design that allows for easy adjustability. Something similar to the Crown and Buckle's Chevron straps.</p>

			<p>Overall, the construction is good.</p>
			
			<p>A minor drawback is that the buckle lacks curvature when viewed from the side. A curved design would enhance comfort by conforming to the contour of the wrist.</p>


		

			<h2>Comfort and Durability</h2>

			<p>This perlon gets the high scores in the comfort segment. Material is lightweight, it bends easily, and it is not difficult to nail the perfect fit.</p>

			  <figcaption>This perlon strap gets high scores in the comfort segment.</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>I only had this strap for two months and so far it hadn't shown any signs of tear or fraying.</p>

			<p>I wore it ob a particularly hot day and I was sweating, but sweet didn't discolor the strap.
			So far it is durable and in pristine condition.</p>
			
			<p class="post-quote"><strong>Initial Usage</strong>
			The strap is easy to adjust and put on. It is very enjoyable to wear it because it's comfortable and lightweight.</p>
			
			<p class="post-quote"><strong>Two months of use</strong>
			I cannot see any visual flaws. I sparingly used the strap, and it is still as new. Although I wore it during the hot days, the color hasn't faded.</p>
			
			<figure>
			  <img src="images/cns-perlon-adjustable-06.jpg" class="stoposto" alt="Adjustable Perlon Strap by CNS &amp; Watch Bands" />
			  <figcaption>Overall, both the construction and durability are surprisingly good.</figcaption>
			</figure>


			<h2>Compatibility and Pairing Recommendation</h2>

			<p>Surprisingly this is a very versatile strap. Although nato straps do not pair well with dress and vintage watches, this perlon can be used with them.</p>

			<p>I tried the field Seiko watch and the setup was completely comfortable.</p>

			<p>The only watches with which this perlon might have issues are top-heavy, large divers, or pilot watches. The material is thin and might not be able to support the overall weight of a watch.</p>

			<p>As for colors, my recommendation is to relax and try bold and punchy colors. Red, yellow, green, purple, azzuro blue... are ideal perlon colors for the summer.</p>

			<h2>Price and Value</h2>

			<p>This product has for a long time remained undiscounted on the CNS site for several months, holding a steady regular price of $12.95.</p>

			<p>But, as I write this review, the Perlon strap 2.0 is currently on sale for the price of $7.95.</p>

			<p>Both price points are highly affordable, and I recommend purchasing this strap.</p>

			<p>Perlon straps are typically considered seasonal items, but I am confident that with proper rotation alongside other straps, it will serve you well for many years to come.</p>

			<p>To answer the initial question: The value is there.</p>
						
			
			
			
			
			<h2>Where to Buy?</h2>
			
			<p>Simply go to <a data-lta-event="review CNS perlon r008" class="company-link" rel="noopener" href="https://cnswatchbands.com/fabric/perlon-watch-straps/">the CNS perlon 2.0 category page</a> and select the color and size you need.</p>

			<p>Buying through CNS is straightforward. No hiccups. If you spend over $25 then you get free standard worldwide shipping.</p>


			
			
			
			<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

			<p>The modest perlon often goes unnoticed, overshadowed by <a class="company-link" href="leather">leather's style</a> and <a class="company-link" href="pass-through">nato's durability</a>. But, it really does have few advantages. It is breathable, lightweight, and most importantly, it's incredibly enjoyable. Treat yourself with few of them, and they will undoubtedly bring you satisfaction.</p>
